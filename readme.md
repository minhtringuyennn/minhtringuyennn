### Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Minh Tri Nguyen. A freelancer. Passionate in coding, design, and photography.

I am currently a sophomore student at Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. Major in Information Technology.

I love to experience, learn, exchange, and be friends with everyone. I believe my strongest trait is my willingness to broaden my experience. I have experienced in competitive code and design projects. I am willing to seeking an internship to enhance my knowledge and skills. Life is an experience, so I want to experience it as much as possible.
